# Project_2


Packages needed to run the notebook:

1) ontobio
pip install ontobio

2) rpy2
pip install rpy2

3) bioinfokit
pip install bioinfokit


In this repository, you need the following files to run the code uploaded:

1) sequence.txt - this is a genome sequence of the tumor protein p63 gene (in the notebook, seqeunce.txt has been renamed to p63_whale.fa)
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/118894681

2) GSE131671_LungBasal.coding.qn.txt - this is a protein expression data of Lung Basal cells in mus musculus (mice) with wild type (with DeltaNp63) and DeltaNp63 knockout (in the notebook, GSE131671_LungBasal.coding.qn.txt has been renamed to GSE131671_LungBasal.txt)
