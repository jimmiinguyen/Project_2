In this repository, you need the following files to run the code uploaded:

1) sequence.txt - this is a genome sequence of the tumor protein p63 gene (in the notebook, seqeunce.txt has been renamed to p63_whale.fa)
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/118894681

2) GSE131671_LungBasal.coding.qn.txt - this is a protein expression data of Lung Basal cells in mus musculus (mice) with wild type (with DeltaNp63) and DeltaNp63 knockout
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE131671


The notebook for running all the code was written in Python
